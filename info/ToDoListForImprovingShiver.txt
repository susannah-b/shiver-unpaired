update manual:
- add to manual contig correction screenshots
- add processing of test data to manual (or GitHub repo?) 
- check it's up-to-date generally before paper publication

check for exit 3 if all cut contigs too small

check for fail points throughout bash, i.e. || { echo 'error'; exit 1; } for every command that doesn't haven't a vanishingly small probability of failure.

Add a maximum gap fraction option to SplitGappyContigs.py (<=50%? histogram)

remove coercion of config file bools: just check they're valid bools

make short contigs file a temp file

fastp program to replace fastaq & Trimmomatic for read trimming?

change my email address throughout code

contig correction: blastn and megablast merged

contig correction: one blast without max-target-seqs = 1 in order to decided what sequence to trim, and one with, to decide where to cut? Or perhaps max-target-seqs > 1 is also fine for choosing where to cut? Run CorrectContigs.py on blast results with and without, get it to output just the blast hits it's keeping after discaring those wholly inside another, and compare.

trim off any overhang past the beginning or end of the alignment (optionally, default yes)

trim off incomplete bit of nef from the alignment? Not reliable for mapping? Reliable for which reads went into which end during de novo asembly?
